Whereas my Flux library is a bit ambitious and tries to cover all the bases in Haxe, this library
just typdefs up good Node.Js libraries instead. I use a functional style and heavily use the scuts functional
library for Haxe, e.g. all my interfaces return promises to validations. 

Libraries used:

Express
Nano
Request
Commander
Mocha

This is a WIP, changing a lot, not documented and not recommended for general use. It's here as a backup. You
may find some tasty morsels though.
